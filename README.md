I had planned to make a website which:

* <b>is independent of Google's Ecosystem</b> : Meaning the data will not be stored on Google's server, but rather be hosted in something similar to NAS using Database
* <b>is a personal project</b>: Meaning it's a project that doesn't share or prioritize the requirements of an outsider. Although anyone is free to suggest changes and provide their valuable feedback.
* <b>is open to collaborations</b>: You can always fork my GitHub repo to make your own version of it. You can also use the same Drive links, or ask for a backup of the original Google Drive that I use.
* <b>appreciates contribution</b>: If you feel like any aspect of this project lacks something, you can always contribute by sharing your feedback. You can also upload Questions/Notes and even add Schedules (that's a related project) to help out your peers.
<!-- <b></b> -->
It's a huge project, and something that I decided on my own accord. Meaning it's <b><i>unofficial and not officially affiliated</i></b> with UITS. As such, anyone is free to recreate and reuse the materials in it (granted they are willing to respect the <b>Copyright rules</b> its licensed under).

I hope this helps many others at least to find their needs a bit more organized.

Good Luck!
